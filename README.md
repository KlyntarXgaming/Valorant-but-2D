# Valorant-but-2D

This project is a 2D game inspired by the popular first-person shooter game "Valorant". It is built using the Pygame library, which provides a suite of tools for creating and managing games in Python. The game features a window with a resolution of 800x600 and a refresh rate of 60 frames per second. The game runs in a loop, checking for user input in the form of mouse or keyboard events. If the player closes the window or presses the "ESCAPE" key, the game will exit. Additionally, if the player presses the "SPACE" key, the game will restart.

Overall, this project serves as a starting point for creating a simple 2D game using Pygame and can be expanded and modified to include additional features, such as character movement, level design, and game mechanics.
