# Valorant-but-2D

This project is a 2D game inspired by the popular first-person shooter game "Valorant". It is built using the Pygame library, which provides a suite of tools for creating and managing games in Python. The game features a window with a resolution of 800x600 and a refresh rate of 60 frames per second. The game runs in a loop, checking for user input in the form of mouse or keyboard events. If the player closes the window or presses the "ESCAPE" key, the game will exit. Additionally, if the player presses the "SPACE" key, the game will restart.

Overall, this project serves as a starting point for creating a simple 2D game using Pygame and can be expanded and modified to include additional features, such as character movement, level design, and game mechanics.

Pygame library provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing 2D games, making it a great choice for beginners. With its support for image and sound assets, as well as its built-in event handling system, Pygame makes it simple to create engaging games that respond to player input.

The code in this project uses Pygame to set up a window with a specified size and refresh rate, and then enters into a main game loop that listens for player events. If the player closes the window or presses the "ESCAPE" key, the game will exit. Alternatively, if the player presses the "SPACE" key, the game will restart. These simple interactions form the foundation of a full-fledged game, and demonstrate how Pygame can be used to create dynamic and responsive gaming experiences.

By building upon this project and adding additional functionality, such as character movement, level design, and game mechanics, you can create complex and engaging games that can be shared with others. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics of game development, or an experienced programmer looking for a new challenge, this project provides a great starting point for creating 2D games in Python.

# Why I made this ðŸ¤” 

I made a game like this beacause I thought It whould be fun so I did it I made a game using python.
